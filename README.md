## üìä Buyer Guide: SFP vs Ethernet | SG10208 vs Alternatives

- **SFP Switch vs Ethernet Switch:**  
  SFP switches allow fiber optic uplinks for long distances, better EMI protection, and security. Ethernet switches are cheaper but limited to copper transmission.

- **Fiber Switch vs Media Converter:**  
  Fiber switches offer scalability and management; media converters are point-to-point and lack VLAN, QoS, and SNMP features.

- **Managed vs Unmanaged SFP Switch:**  
  Managed switches like the SG10208 provide traffic control, network monitoring, and advanced features. Unmanaged switches are plug-and-play with minimal control.

- **8 SFP Switch vs 4 SFP Switch:**  
  More SFP ports = more scalability. Ideal for growing infrastructures or fiber-heavy topologies.

- **Rackmount vs Desktop Fiber Switch:**  
  Choose rackmount for data centers and enterprises; desktop for small-scale setups.

- **Layer 2 vs Layer 3 SFP Switch:**  
  SG10208 is Layer 2 ‚Äì perfect for VLANs, QoS, and standard switching. Choose Layer 3 if you need routing capabilities.
